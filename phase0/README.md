# Program Walkthrough
The login System will run if we run the main method. We would firstly
create an Admin User, and then you could choose to log in, create a new account, or end the program. You could type 
in the number for the option. 
During the login stage, you will input your username and password. 
 If you logged in, you would see a list of things you could do. 
A Regular User could view history, log out, and delete their own account. 
Besides a Regular User's function, an Admin User could create a new user, ban a Regular User, Unban a Regular User, 
and delete a Regular User. 
After you log out, you could choose to log in, create a new account, and end the program again.
